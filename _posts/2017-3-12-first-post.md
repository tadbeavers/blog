I figure I may as well begin with a dream I had the other night, just before starting this workshop where I learned to use git, bash, and python. 

<p>
First, let me begin by commenting how I rarely ever dream. Like, 2 or 3 a year.... Maybe it is the changes that abound in my life right now or maybe it was something else, but I remember this one quite vividly even a day later. 

<p>
It began simply enough. It was a gray and cloudy day in the Pacific Northwest and I found myself walking down the streets I drive, every day to work for the last 4 years, until a week ago, that is. As I passed by the standard food truck fare (always a salvadorian restaurant) the world suddenly changed. Like a scene from the popular mobile game, Ingress, I saw a sudden flash of bright electrical light. A huddle of people by the foodtruck, clustered near the open window, were suddenly enthralled in a field of energy. The air was filled with the sharp screams of humans and their was an acrid smell of ozone and burning flesh. As I slowed to a stop and watched in horrow, I witnessed a dozen or so humans suddenly melt and be destroyed into nothing but a black char. As I watched this, I witnessed dark shadow-like beings, akin to dementors, swoop from unnaturaly realms-above, below, from nowhere... They descended on the humans in what I can only describe as a feeding frenzy and I knew, deep in my gut, that they were not just consuming the flesh of these people, but their very souls and spirits.

<p>
Well, I noped out of there pretty damn quick. Whatever I had been planning left my mind in a hurry and I began to run back to the safe seclusion of my neighborhood where I have lived for several years. At this point, I realized that this event was not just localized, screams of terror rang out in all directions. The shadow-beings could be seen al over town, hovering above, around, and generally anywhere. There were no physical limitations to these creatures. Whatever realm they sprung from, they were clearly not inhibited by our dimensional rules or physics. 

<p> Like a cliche, I ran into a wise old man. This Gandalf figure who I normally would have assumed was homeless, approached me. Relieved to see another living human, I began to chat with him and he revieled to me that these creatures had always inhabited our realm. It was only now that others could see them and, he began to whisper, once you could see them, you always would... He entoned that these beings were, as I thought, not of our dimension and that we, feeble humans, were simply food to them. As the tropes began to fall heavier and heavier he said the final line that devout extremist have beligerently screamed for millenia, "The end is here."

<p>
That was about all I needed to feel a fresh surge of panic for my fiance, Anna. Leaping into action mode and using the timewarping abilities of dreamscape, I leapt to the future and arrived at my home. Grabbing her and everything I could think we would need, we jammed into my car and hit the road. Thinking that a little gas would go a long way, I stopped by the nearest gas station where I found a mass of people. Getting my spot near a pump, I walked over to the pay station and found myself unusually bewildered.
